        In the following, you will be shown a transcript of a conversation you had with another user. However, the transcript may have been altered from the original version such that some of your response(s) have been replaced with text generated by a different language model or with modified versions of your original responses. A subsequent task will ask you to identify which responses were replaced.

        In the following, you will be shown a user request followed by two responses to that request. One of the responses was produced by you in another conversation, while the other response is either a modified version of your original response or text generated by a different language model. A subsequent task will ask you to identify which response was originally produced by you.
