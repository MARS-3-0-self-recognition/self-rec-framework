# Self-Recognition

## Setup

### Install `uv`
Follow instructions on [uv docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
If you have a mac, it is probably easiest to use homebrew.

### Clone the repository
And navigate to the directory
```
git clone git@github.com:W-L-W/EvalAwareness.git
cd EvalAwareness
```

### Sync uv
Sync dependencies and create virtual environment with development tools (includes ipykernel for Jupyter notebooks, pre-commit, etc):
```
uv sync --extra dev
```

### Install pre-commit hooks
(this ensures code quality checks run automatically on every commit):
```
uv run pre-commit install
```

### Inspect plug-in
Install the inspect plug-in for vscode to easily view eval-logs.

## Usage

To run commands in the virtual environment, use `uv run`:
```
uv run your_script.py
```

To activate the virtual environment manually (if needed):
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Pre-commit Hooks
Once installed, pre-commit hooks will run automatically on every `git commit`. You can also run them manually:
```
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

To update pre-commit hook versions:
```
uv run pre-commit autoupdate
```
