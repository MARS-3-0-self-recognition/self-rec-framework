For refrigeration, oysters should be kept in their shells on a bed of ice in an open-top container, with the deep side facing down, and covered with a damp towel or paper towel to prevent drying out. The refrigerator temperature should be between 35-40\u00b0F, and oysters should be stored above raw meat to avoid cross-contamination. Oysters can be safely stored in the refrigerator for up to two days, and daily checks are recommended to ensure the towel remains damp and ice is replaced as it melts. For longer storage, oysters can be frozen for up to three months; when freezing, they should be placed in a freezer-safe, moisture-resistant container, preferably with their internal liquor to preserve juiciness. If shucking before freezing, leave minimal head space in the container and seal it tightly. When ready to consume, oysters should be thawed slowly in the refrigerator, which can take up to 20 hours, or quickly in cold water if immediate consumption is planned. Before eating, it's crucial to inspect the oysters for any signs of spoilage such as damaged shells, foul odors, or discolored meat, and discard any oysters that appear questionable to prevent potential food poisoning."
